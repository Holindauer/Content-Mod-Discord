The provided .jpg illustrates the plan for implementation as of 8/16/23.
A brief explanation follows:

The discord bot will monitor incoming messages from the server. These 
messages will be sent to the rule adherance calssifier which will determine
whether the message is appropriate. This initial RAC is intended to be as
simple of a model as possible to reduce computational load. 

If the RAC predicts the message is appropriate, no further action will be
taken against that user. If the message is classified as innapropriate, it
will be sent to two models. Although, it might be benificial down the line
to combine these two models into a single model that can perform both tasks
in a single output. We'll see as the proj solidifies. 

The first of these downstream models is a clean summarization model. It will
take the message marked as innapropriate and provide a summarization that itself
is appropriate. The other of these models is a parts of speech tagging model that
will take the message as input and output only the innapropriate words/statements
that are deemed innapropriate. 

The outputs of these models will be used to send the user who sent the message a 
dm contain an explanation of why their message was innapropriate. There will be an
option for the user to appeal this violation. If the user does not wish to appeal, 
then the appropriate corrective action will be taken against their account within
the server. 

If the user does appeal the violation, then the message will be sent to a more 
sophisticated language model for further inspection of whether the message actually
breaks the rules. If it does break the rules. Corrective action will be taken.

This illustrates how the bot will moderate messages incoming into the server.
