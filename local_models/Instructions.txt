Instructions if model downloader fails:



To run models locally, download the model files from this google drive folder:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MUpmOU9G1g0DljfV35ddwehzG0w1S69W?usp=sharing

This link will take you inside a drive folder called Models

Click on the title of the folder and download the zipped file.

Unzip the file inside of this directory and place the Models directory inside the local_models dir.

The bot will read the files in from Content-Mod-DiscordBot/local_models/Models/Directory_Containing_Model_Files

The Directory_Containing_Model_Files is specific to which model is being accessed.



Also, check if the Models dir has been deleted. That is needed for the models to be downloaded.
